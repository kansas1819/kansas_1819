* commit all changes made to flow_0.2
* go to the sas folder and either replace the contents of flow with flow_0.2, or paste flow_0.2, rename flow to flow.old and create a new softlink to a new directory named flow.
* No need to create a run directory
* just run pdfgensetup.py in the folder where you want to create the run directory. the function needs to following arguments: 
	--rundir [intended run directory path. **it will create the run directory**]  
	--csvdir [path of the directory containing the (accurately named) sample csv]
	--flowdir [path to the flow directory (or softlink created in step 2)].

AFTER pdfgensetup.py
* now go to the run directory you created on step 2 of the above section
* make a soft link to the Makefile.SUB and name it Makefile
* do a dry run
* run make -j4 >[logfilename.log] 2>&1
* on a new window run top and check the number of processes running from time to time.
